# Logic gates

## NAND
- Input A (0/1)
- Input B (0/1)

0 / 0 = 1
0 / 1 = 1
1 / 0 = 1
1 / 1 = 0

- Create a AND gate
- Add a NOT gate on the and

## AND with NAND gates
- NAND is a reversed AND
- Getting NAND inputs from the same output act as a inverter
- First NAND is a AND with a reversed end, second NAND will reverse it
A->
    :NAND -< :NAND - 
B->

## Gates
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR (exclusive OR)
