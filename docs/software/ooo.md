# OOO - Object Oriented Programming

## Public vs Private
- Those objects have public and private methods, because some functions should not be accessed externally, for example a function that fireSparkPlug1 should only be accessed by the IgnitionControl class, where the function getSparkVoltage could be public

## Examples of OOPL
- C, C++, C#

## Acronyms
- IDE: Integrated Development Environment
