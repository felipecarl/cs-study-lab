# Beggining


## What is a computer
- Input (user data input)
- Processing (CPU transforms data)
- Memory (stores temporarily or permanently)
- Output (result) 

## Turing machine
- Goal was to run any algorithm
- If a machine can do calculations as a turing machine, it is called turing complete
- Turing machines can perform any calculations given enough time/memory
- There are some problems that cannot be solved, 

## Turing test
- A test designed to test if a computer can pass as a person
- Ideally a person would talk to a computer and a person, and try to find out which one is the computer
- CAPTCHA (completely automated public turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is an example of this
