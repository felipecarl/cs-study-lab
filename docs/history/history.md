# History

- Ada Lovelace is considered the worlds first programmer for creating a hypotethical language for the "analytical computer"
- Herman Hollerith created the tabulating machine in 1890 to process the US Census, it worked with punch cards, with later in 1924 merged and created the "International Business Machines" or IBM, they were "eletro-mechanical"
- Before, those computers worked with relays, that are circuits that connect when a coil is energized, it will attract the wire and close the connection
- As relays arms had mass, they weren't fast enough, a good relay in 1940 would flick back and forth fifty times in a second, looks fast but not enough
- Hardvard Mark I could do 3 add or subtractions per second, multiplications took 6s and divisions took 15s
- Another problem was wear and tear, Mark I had 3500+ relays
- Grace Hopper found a moth inside Mark I, wich caused issues, that's when they started calling issues as "bugs"
- In 1904 John Fleming created a Thermionic Valve, which was a vacuum bulb with electrodes inside, working like a diode
- In 1906 Lee de Forest improved this design, creating something acting like a relay but without moving parts, that could switch thousands of times per second, but they were fragile and expensive
- The ENIAC was the first one created with vacuum tubes, having 18000 vac tubes inside
- In 1947 the transistor was created at Bell Lab, by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley
- Modern transistors are 50 nanometers small, and switch states millions of times per second, and run for decades
- Boolean comes from George Boole, with later Boolean Algebra got its name, self taught english mathematician in the 1800s
- Fundamental operations from bool algebra: NOT, AND & OR
