## Transistor
- Two electrodes separated by a material that sometimes can conduct electricity and other times resist it, so a "semiconductor"
- The first transistor created at bell labs could switch 10000 times per second
- They were solid material, so "solid state components"
- Also, smaller, much smaller than tubes or relays
  
### NOT Gate Transistor
- A The output is connected to the Energy source, and a ground to the usual output, so when the base is energized, the current flows to the ground, not leaving any energy to the output

### AND Gate
- Two transistors connected in series, so the current will flow only if both transistors are energized

### OR Gate
- Two transistors connected in parallel
